## Transit Oriented Development: What can Los Angeles learn from Seoul? 
###### Audrey Jang and Shinah Park 

### Introduction 
Los Angeles plans to invest a whopping [$400 billion](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.itsinternational.com/its9/news/la-approves-400bn-30-year-transport-plan&sa=D&ust=1611101708988000&usg=AOvVaw3CBMGMMdDWrwvPh7dS4IuI) in its public transit system, over the next thirty years. LA Metro’s 2020 Long Range Transportation Plan aims for 21% of LA County residents and 36% of jobs to be “within a 10-minute walk of high-quality rail or bus rapid transit options.” It will be the ["largest-ever"](https://www.gsd.harvard.edu/2019/08/facing-the-nations-largest-ever-infrastructure-investment-gsd-students-ask-who-stands-to-benefit-from-a-less-car-centric-la/) infrastructure investment in the nation’s history.

What will a transit-oriented Los Angeles look like? It does not have much of a domestic example to look to; American public transit infrastructure [lags](https://www.vice.com/en/article/884kvk/why-the-us-sucks-at-building-public-transit) terribly behind in function, comfort, and safety, and transit ridership has [fallen](https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2018/9/26/17903146/mass-transit-public-transit-rail-subway-bus-car) in every city except NYC since 2012 despite improvements.

Instead, we look towards Asia -- specifically, to Seoul, South Korea. Seoul’s extensive network of rail and bus consistently ranks as one of the [best](https://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/travel-leisure/article/3075591/asia-has-top-three-mass-transit-systems-world-and-thats) in the world, supporting [65%](https://blogs.iadb.org/transporte/en/how-south-korea-is-managing-public-transportation-under-covid-19/) of average daily traffic as of August 2020. Los Angeles County and the Seoul Capital Area cover comparable swaths of land (4,751 and 4,519 sq mi, respectively), developed and developing in polycentric patterns. Observing how Seoul “sprawls densely,” one [blogger](https://entrepot.blog/2020/05/08/how-should-la-urbanize-look-to-seoul/) makes the case that the Asian metropolis provides a more natural comparison to Los Angeles than the “Euro-Atlantic core-periphery development model” of New York City or London. So we pose our research question: What insights might be derived from studying Seoul’s transportation network that could inform the transit-oriented development of Los Angeles?  

### Spatial Scope
The official boundaries of Los Angeles County and the Seoul Metropolitan Area demarcate the spatial scope of this project. We seek to compare and contrast the physical form of the two, starting with their street grids and then exploring population density, bus and rail networks, ridership, and pedestrian networks. Our results will primarily reflect point-in-time snapshots of these variables, and we will seek to compare data from the same year where availability permits. 

For a brief overview of the administrative divisions of [Los Angeles County](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Los_Angeles_County) and [Seoul Metropolitan Area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administrative_divisions_of_South_Korea), see below: 
 
> Much of the Government of California is in practice the responsibility of county governments, such as the Government of Los Angeles County. The County government provides countywide services such as elections and voter registration, law enforcement, jails, vital records, property records, tax collection, public health, health care, and social services. In addition the County serves as the local government for all unincorporated areas.
 
> South Korea is made up of 17 first-tier administrative divisions: 6 metropolitan cities (gwangyeoksi 광역시), 1 special city (teukbyeolsi 특별시), 1 special self-governing city (teukbyeol-jachisi 특별자치시), and 9 provinces (do 도), including one special self-governing province (teukbyeol jachido 특별자치도). These are further subdivided into a variety of smaller entities, including cities (si 시), counties (gun 군), districts (gu 구), towns (eup 읍), townships (myeon 면), neighborhoods (dong 동) and villages (ri 리).

We expect to use Census Tract level data for Los Angeles County and dong-level data for Seoul Metropolitan Area. 

### Data 
We will examine data for the following information for both metropolitan areas: 
* Boundaries 
* Population density
* Employment density 
* Street grids 
* Highway network 
* Rail stations or lines 
* Rail ridership
* Bus Rapid Transit stations or lines 
* BRT ridership 
* Rivers/waterways
* Pedestrian network

According to the Mckinsey report (2018), availability, affordability, efficiency, and convenience are important factors that should be considered when evaluating a transit system. Fully evaluating the success of a transportation system would involve criteria beyond the scope of this study, including affordability and convenience. We focus on availability and access, which we assess by measuring and comparing ridership, proximity to population and employment centers, and connectivity to pedestrian networks.

| Pedestrian/Active Transport Networks  | The [LA City Bike+Ped Count](https://la-bike.org/our-work/bike-ped-count/) is the largest source of data on the numbers of people that walk and bike on Los Angeles streets. Partnering with LADOT, this organization [in 2019](https://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=9a4f141cfec34635a1459d8ed58681a7) collected demonstrates year-over-year increases in the numbers of people biking and walking, particularly where the city has installed new and improved infrastructure, and helps make the case for further investment in our communities.     [LA County Walk Score](https://data.lacounty.gov/Sustainability/Walk-Score-2019-/nnyu-hjy4)  is a service that grades the “walkability” of select geographies. Their methodology is proprietary, and historical information is only available with a subscription. Data includes individual Walk Score for each available city and unincorporated community within LA County. Average walk score for each city and neighborhood was created – from most walkable to least (highest score to lowest score).       |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |


### Methodology 
According to the Mckinsey report (2018), availability, affordability, efficiency, and convenience are important factors that should be considered when evaluating a transit system. Fully evaluating the success of a transportation system would involve criteria beyond the scope of this study, including affordability and convenience. We focus on availability and access, which we assess by measuring and comparing ridership, proximity to population and employment centers, and connectivity to pedestrian networks.   

1. In this step, we define the boundaries of the analysis sites. We use shape files provided by public databases and OpenStreetMap to check the urban form of each metropolitan area. In order to understand the basic geospatial features of Seoul and L.A., we will generate two maps depicting their street grids using the OSMnx library.

2. In this step, we aim to compare the population and job density of Seoul and L.A. For each urban area, we will divide the total surface area into one-mile squares. We will join population and job location statistics to identify residential and employment hubs, examining how they are distributed within the metropolitan boundary. We will create 4 maps in this step, two for each metropolis, that shows the density and distribution of population and employment.

3. In this step, we analyze how people use the rail system by exploring rail ridership data. We will append ridership data and rail station shapefiles to visualize the ridership at each station. The results will be shown by the two railway station location maps that have different buffer size proportional to ridership at each station.

4. In this step, we will analyze how people use the bus rapid transit system by exploring bus ridership data. We will use the same method used for the rail ridership data to visualize the people’s behavior. Particularly, we aim to create a graph that shows the change in transit ridership of Seoul before and after the BRT construction.

5. In this step, we will map the highway network of LA, which has  been identified as potential candidates for expanding its bus rapid transit. A map showing the highway-level street will be produced in this stage. We may generate a highway map for Seoul as well.  

6. In this step, we assess the accessibility on foot for each rail station by overlaying the transit station map with the pedestrian network. Besides the street grid, we are interested in exploring proximity of transit nodes to special pedestrian networks, such as greenbelts along river tributaries. We will produce a half mile buffer from each rail station, to mark the ten-minute walk distance for planning transit-supportive density.  Two maps showing pedestrian networks will be produced in this step and a table of distance to the pedestrian network would be necessary to interpret the result.

7. Finally, we will interpret our data and maps, analyzing and comparing the physical form of transit infrastructure, as well as the spatial distribution of people, stations, and ridership in each urban area. 




### Insights 
What substantive insights could possibly be derived from comparing two cities on opposite sides of the globe, with such different political, historical, cultural, and geographic contexts? The polycentric regional development of Asian cities results from governance structures and economic forces distinct from those driving post-suburbanization of Los Angeles and other Euro-American cities. But we still stubbornly go forth, not least because the chosen case studies reflect our group’s desire to compare the two cities with which we are personally most familiar. 

Why is L.A. car-centric, and what is it about Seoul that allowed its transit-oriented development? Much ink has already spilled on explaining away why L.A. transit infrastructure falls so obviously behind Asian cities: car culture, high construction costs, lack of [political will](https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2018/9/26/17903146/mass-transit-public-transit-rail-subway-bus-car) to [sufficiently invest](https://usa.streetsblog.org/2020/01/08/too-little-too-late-a-decade-of-transit-investment-in-the-u-s/) in public transit. We do not expect to find magical solutions to these challenges in the urban form of Seoul. Implementation questions aside, we compare the physical forms of the two metropolitan areas, in hopes that identifying their similarities and dissimilarities may open new opportunities for intervention.

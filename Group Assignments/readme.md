## Transit Oriented Development: What can Los Angeles learn from Seoul? 
###### Audrey Jang and Shinah Park 

### Introduction 
Los Angeles plans to invest a whopping [$400 billion](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.itsinternational.com/its9/news/la-approves-400bn-30-year-transport-plan&sa=D&ust=1611101708988000&usg=AOvVaw3CBMGMMdDWrwvPh7dS4IuI) in its public transit system, over the next thirty years. LA Metro’s 2020 Long Range Transportation Plan aims for 21% of LA County residents and 36% of jobs to be “within a 10-minute walk of high-quality rail or bus rapid transit options.” It will be the ["largest-ever"](https://www.gsd.harvard.edu/2019/08/facing-the-nations-largest-ever-infrastructure-investment-gsd-students-ask-who-stands-to-benefit-from-a-less-car-centric-la/) infrastructure investment in the nation’s history.

What will a transit-oriented Los Angeles look like? It does not have much of a domestic example to look to; American public transit infrastructure [lags](https://www.vice.com/en/article/884kvk/why-the-us-sucks-at-building-public-transit) terribly behind in function, comfort, and safety, and transit ridership has [fallen](https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2018/9/26/17903146/mass-transit-public-transit-rail-subway-bus-car) in every city except NYC since 2012 despite improvements.

Instead, we look towards Asia -- specifically, to Seoul, South Korea. Seoul’s extensive network of rail and bus consistently ranks as one of the [best](https://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/travel-leisure/article/3075591/asia-has-top-three-mass-transit-systems-world-and-thats) in the world, supporting [65%](https://blogs.iadb.org/transporte/en/how-south-korea-is-managing-public-transportation-under-covid-19/) of average daily traffic as of August 2020. Los Angeles County and the Seoul Capital Area cover comparable swaths of land (4,751 and 4,519 sq mi, respectively), developed and developing in polycentric patterns. Observing how Seoul “sprawls densely,” one [blogger](https://entrepot.blog/2020/05/08/how-should-la-urbanize-look-to-seoul/) makes the case that the Asian metropolis provides a more natural comparison to Los Angeles than the “Euro-Atlantic core-periphery development model” of New York City or London. So we pose our research question: What insights might be derived from studying Seoul’s transportation network that could inform the transit-oriented development of Los Angeles?  

### Spatial Scope
The official boundaries of Los Angeles County and the Seoul Metropolitan Area demarcate the spatial scope of this project. We seek to compare and contrast the physical form of the two, starting with their street grids and then exploring population density, bus and rail networks, ridership, and pedestrian networks. Our results will primarily reflect point-in-time snapshots of these variables, and we will seek to compare data from the same year where availability permits. 

### Data 
We will examine data for the following information for both metropolitan areas: 
* Boundaries 
* Population density
* Employment density 
* Street grids 
* Highway network 
* Rail stations or lines 
* Rail ridership
* Bus Rapid Transit stations or lines 
* BRT ridership 
* Rivers/waterways
* Pedestrian network

According to the Mckinsey report (2018), availability, affordability, efficiency, and convenience are important factors that should be considered when evaluating a transit system. Fully evaluating the success of a transportation system would involve criteria beyond the scope of this study, including affordability and convenience. We focus on availability and access, which we assess by measuring and comparing ridership, proximity to population and employment centers, and connectivity to pedestrian networks.   

### Insights 
What substantive insights could possibly be derived from comparing two cities on opposite sides of the globe, with such different political, historical, cultural, and geographic contexts? The polycentric regional development of Asian cities results from governance structures and economic forces distinct from those driving post-suburbanization of Los Angeles and other Euro-American cities. But we still stubbornly go forth, not least because the chosen case studies reflect our group’s desire to compare the two cities with which we are personally most familiar. 

Why is L.A. car-centric, and what is it about Seoul that allowed its transit-oriented development? Much ink has already spilled on explaining away why L.A. transit infrastructure falls so obviously behind Asian cities: car culture, high construction costs, lack of [political will](https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2018/9/26/17903146/mass-transit-public-transit-rail-subway-bus-car) to [sufficiently invest](https://usa.streetsblog.org/2020/01/08/too-little-too-late-a-decade-of-transit-investment-in-the-u-s/) in public transit. We do not expect to find magical solutions to these challenges in the urban form of Seoul. Implementation questions aside, we compare the physical forms of the two metropolitan areas, in hopes that identifying their similarities and dissimilarities may open new opportunities for intervention.

Los Angeles plans to invest a whopping $400 billion in its public transit system, over the next thirty years. LA Metro’s 2020 Long Range Transportation Plan aims for 21% of LA County residents and 36% of jobs to be “within a 10-minute walk of high-quality rail or bus rapid transit options.” It will be the largest-ever infrastructure investment in the nation’s history.
What will a transit-oriented Los Angeles look like? It does not have much of a domestic example to look to; American public transit infrastructure lags terribly behind in function, comfort, and safety, and transit ridership has fallen in every city except NYC since 2012 despite improvements.  
Instead, we look towards Asia -- specifically, to Seoul, South Korea. Seoul’s extensive network of rail and bus consistently ranks as one of the best in the world, supporting 65% of average daily traffic as of August 2020. Los Angeles County and the Seoul Capital Area cover comparable swaths of land (4,751 and 4,519 sq mi, respectively), developed and developing in polycentric patterns. Observing how Seoul “sprawls densely,” one blogger makes the case that the Asian metropolis provides a more natural comparison to Los Angeles than the “Euro-Atlantic core-periphery development model” of New York City or London. So we pose our research question: What insights might be derived from studying Seoul’s transportation network that could inform the transit-oriented development of Los Angeles?

## Week4 - Mini Group Assignment (Status Report)

### 1. Project title and link to proposal
• Project title: _Transit Oriented Development: What can Los Angeles learn from Seoul?_   
• Link to proposal: https://github.com/audreyyj/ShinahAudrey/tree/main/Group%20Assignments   
• Given that cloud-based Jupyter notebooks are limited in memory, we have decided to identify neighborhoods in each city for deeper street grid and transit network analysis. This will be reflected in our updated project proposal for the midterm. 

### 2. Roles: Give each team member a title, and define what role each team member will play, and how each person plans to contribute to the project. While this may be subject to change, it is a good idea to define this early in the project to clarify "who is doing what."
#### Shinah Park, International Project Consultant, Seoul Metro    
• Secure datasets for Seoul Metropolitan Area    
• Identify Seoul neighborhoods to analyze by population and job density     
• Clean commute data for both LA and Seoul    
• Study LA transit network data   
• LA Ridership (Audrey needs to find ridership data)   
• Create comparative tables, graphs, and maps with Audrey 
#### Audrey Younsook Jang, Domestic Project Manager, LA Metro    
• Secure datasets for Los Angeles County    
• Identify neighborhoods to analyze by population and job density    
• Conduct OSMnx analysis for both LA and Seoul neighborhoods   
• Try to find walkshed/driveshed     
• Study Seoul transit network data   
• Seoul Ridership    
• Create comparative tables, graphs, and maps with Shinah   

### 3. Status update: Report on the general mood of the team, and provide details as to what is working, and what is not.
#### General mood:   
• We are both excited to be expanding our coding skills, and exchange knowledge about our respective cities with each other. We chose our research question because we wanted our project to equally incorporate Shinah’s familiarity with Seoul and Audrey’s familiarity with LA equally.   
• We are a little worried about the comparative analysis, especially whether we’d be able to find appropriate metrics to compare between the two cities. 
#### What’s working:   
• We chose very basic data to analyze - population density, job density, and physical location of rail and transit - which is allowing us to practice the fundamental skills we are learning in class. We have successfully figured out how to calculate population and job density, in order to identify neighborhoods for our case studies.   
#### What’s not working:   
• Dividing the work of our project would be much easier if Shinah just focused on Seoul, and Audrey focused on LA. However, each of us want to learn more about both cities and play a role in the respective analysis. Given that we cannot work on the same Jupyter notebook at the same time, it is difficult for one person to build on top of data that was cleaned/edited by another person.   
• Our project workflow is pretty linear. We want to get using OSMnx and comparing between Seoul and LA, but we cannot do that until we have mapped population density, job density, and commute mode data to identify neighborhoods to compare. We are both encountering issues in mapping our data, which is hindering our ability to move onto the comparative analysis. 

### 4. Data update: Provide a short narrative on where you are with the data sources you will incorporate in your project. Provide links as necessary.   
#### We realized that we should analyze population and job density, not just the raw population and job concentration numbers.   
#### LA Metro’s Interactive Ridership Data only shows systemwide numbers, and the line-by-line numbers don’t change when we click through them. We emailed LA Metro but have not heard back.

#### As we were exploring datasets available through the U.S. Census Bureau, we found Travel Mode dataset for L.A.(https://censusreporter.org/tables/B08006/) and decided to add that to our exploratory analysis. We found commute mode data for Seoul as well: http://data.seoul.go.kr/dataList/10283/S/2/datasetView.do 

### 5. Concerns: There should be a lot to be concerned about at this phase of the project. List those concerns and classify them as "Major concerns" and/or "Minor concerns."
#### Major Concerns:
• Joining datasets to get the same geographic scale   
• Seoul transit line (both bus and rail) spatial data availability   
• LA ridership data availability 

#### Minor concerns: 
• Issues with projections of spatial datasets for both LA and Seoul   
• Mapping more than one dataset on the same axes

| Boundaries/borders      | This [dataset](https://geohub.lacity.org/datasets/10f1e37c065347e693cf4e8ee753c09b_15) demarcates the official boundaries of Los Angeles County.                                                                              |  This [dataset](http://www.gisdeveloper.co.kr/?p=2332) shows the official boundaries of the entire South Korea. We can export the areas that we need. This [dataset](http://data.nsdi.go.kr/dataset/15145) shows the official boundaries of each city unit.

| Employment Density      | We will use [On the Map](https://onthemap.ces.census.gov/  ) job data to find employment density.                                                                                                                             | This [Employment data](https://data.seoul.go.kr/dataList/10598/S/2/datasetView.do), provided by Seoul Metropolitan open-data center, shows the number of people employed in each ‘dong’ scale jurisdiction.

| Commute Mode            | As we were exploring datasets available through the U.S. Census Bureau, we found this [Travel Mode dataset](https://censusreporter.org/tables/B08006/) and decided to add that to our exploratory analysis.                   | This [dataset](http://data.seoul.go.kr/dataList/10283/S/2/datasetView.do), found in Seoul Metropolitan open-data center, has commute mode data for Seoul.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Rail Ridership          | L.A. Metro’s [Interactive Estimated Ridership Stats](https://www.metro.net/news/ridership-statistics/)*  includes Monthly Ridership stats, Line Level trends, and Historical information. We also requested data to LA Metro for ridership by station. | This is [data](https://data.seoul.go.kr/dataList/OA-12914/S/1/datasetView.do) provided by a credit card company that shows daily ridership by station. (In Korea, most people pay fares by tagging their credit cards when entering platforms.)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Rail stations and lines | This L.A. Metro [dataset](https://developer.metro.net/docs/gis-data/overview/ ) provides 2 types of line shapefile (Bus Lines and Rail Lines) and three types of point shapefile (Bus Stops, Rail Stations and Rail Portals). | This [data](http://www.seoulmetro.co.kr/kr/board.do?menuIdx=551&bbsIdx=2210979), provided by Seoul Metro shows text addresses of rail stations. We will geocode the station addresses and make them into point data. |
